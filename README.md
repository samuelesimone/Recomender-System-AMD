# Algorithms for Massive Dataset project 2022-2023

This repo contains the projects for the «Algorithms for massive datasets» course taught at the Master in «Computer Science» at the Università degli Studi di Milano.

I choose to focus on the **Recommender System**.
The task is to implement from scratch a system recommending businesses to users. You are free to choose the technique at the basis of the recommender system, as well as the strategy to be used in order to populate the utility matrix.

# Dataset

The projects described in this document refer to the «[Yelp](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)» dataset, which is published on Kaggle and released under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, with attribution required.

# Instructions


There are two folders within the repository.

In the **Notebook** folder is the Jupiter notebook file which is also accessible via badge from here:

In the **Report** folder, on the other hand, you can find the pdf of the report under the path *Report -> Main -> AMD_Main_Samuele_Simone.pdf*. 

Remember to enter your Kaggle credentials before running the code so that you can download the data.
